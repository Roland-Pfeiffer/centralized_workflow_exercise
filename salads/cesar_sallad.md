## Tips

- For an authentic Caesar salad experience, you can add anchovy fillets (1-2) to the dressing for extra flavor.
- Top the salad with grilled chicken, shrimp, or salmon for added protein.
- Homemade croutons can enhance the flavor. Simply toss bread cubes with olive oil, salt, and garlic powder, and bake at 350°F (175°C) until golden brown.
